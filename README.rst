Photo gallery app for Django using PostgreSQL-specific goodies.

Overview
========

This is yet another Django app for creating and managing photos and photo
galleries, but with a PostgreSQL twist. It was made to show off some of the
advanced PostgreSQL features, therefore it is deliberately not portable
to other RDBMS-es.

Features
========

 * image tagging with array data type
 * storing EXIF data in HStore fields
